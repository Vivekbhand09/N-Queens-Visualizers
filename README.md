# N-Queens-Visualizers

Developed an interactive visualizer for the classic N-Queen Problem, which demonstrates how queens can be placed on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. Implemented using backtracking algorithm, the visualizer dynamically showcases the step-by-step placement and backtracking of queens, helping users understand the recursive approach intuitively.

ðŸ§  Algorithm Used: Backtracking (DFS)

ðŸ“Š Features: Board generation for custom N size, real-time queen placement animation, conflict detection
