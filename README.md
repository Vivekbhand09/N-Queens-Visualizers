# ♟️ N-Queens Visualizer

An interactive visualizer for the classic **N-Queens Problem**, which illustrates how to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project uses a **backtracking algorithm** to dynamically showcase each recursive step, allowing users to visually understand the process of backtracking and conflict resolution.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Backtracking (DFS)**  
  A depth-first approach is used to explore all possible placements of queens, backtracking whenever a conflict occurs.

---

## 📊 Features

- Custom board size (choose any value of N)
- Real-time animation of queen placement and backtracking
- Highlights conflicting positions and successful solutions
- Clean and responsive UI for a better learning experience
